# Verilog-based-SD-card-reader-via-SPI
Verilog-based SD card initialization and read modules, along with an SD card functional model (supporting initialization and read responses). The design implements the SPI protocol and preloads data from a PC-based text file to simulate the real-world process of data retrieval from an SD card via SPI.
